NextJS Material Dashboard is a free Material-UI, NextJS and React Admin with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. We are very excited to introduce our take on the material concepts through an easy to use and beautiful set of components. NextJS Material Dashboard was built over the popular Material-UI, NextJS and React frameworks.

NextJS Material Dashboard makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left sidebar and the content is on the right inside the main panel.

NextJS Material Dashboard comes with 5 color filter choices for both the sidebar and the card headers (blue, green, orange, red and purple) and an option to have a background image on the sidebar.

NextJS Material Dashboard was created using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/?ref=creativetim) and it uses a framework built by our friend [Olivier - Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui?ref=creativetim), who did an amazing job creating the backbone for the material effects, animations, ripples and transitions. Big thanks to his team for the effort and forward thinking they put into it.

We are very excited to share this dashboard with you and we look forward to hearing your feedback!

It is open source, and it's Github Repo can be found [here](https://github.com/creativetimofficial/nextjs-material-dashboard).
